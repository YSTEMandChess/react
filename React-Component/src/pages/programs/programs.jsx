            Our program was designed to help the most vulnerable students find
            their own success in STEM. We figured that if we could get students
            to graduate with a STEM degree, we could break the cycle of poverty
            in one generation. The founders were tired of help being promised
            every year, every election, every generation. We are helping our
            students help themselves.
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            That is why our program is FREE to students from at-risk
            backgrounds, schools or organizations that help disadvantaged
            communities, specifically those that qualify for free and reduced
            lunch.
