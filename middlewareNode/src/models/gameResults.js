/**
 * Game Results Schema
 *
 * One immutable record per finished student-vs-student chess game.
 *
 * This is the single source of truth for competitive-play stats. Nothing
 * stores a running "chess score" on the user document — wins/draws/losses and
 * the derived score are computed on read from these records (see
 * utils/studentStats.getChessRecord), the same way the leaderboard computes
 * every other stat. That keeps the score reproducible: change the weights and
 * every historical game re-scores, with no backfill.
 *
 * `gameId` is unique, which is also the idempotency key: a reconnect, a retry,
 * or both clients reporting the same game can never double-count it.
 *
 * Records are written only by the chessServer at game end (checkmate, resign,
 * or disconnect-forfeit) via POST /gameResults.
